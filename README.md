# wm-silnite
Custom plugin for [Watchman Monitoring](https://www.watchmanmonitoring.com) to provide results if an OS update is available.

Alerting if specific Apple security updates have not been installed, or are available for installation.

## As of version .9.9.2.0
* No longer relies on `silnite` for any reporting.
* Uses [Sofa](https://sofa.macadmins.io/getting-started.html) to determine if updates are available.
*	[Based on this example](https://github.com/macadmins/sofa/blob/main/tool-scripts/macOSVersionCheck-EA.sh).
* Simplified output to the dashboard.
* Includes latest release date.
* Informational warning (no ticket/email) if update was released within the last 8 days.
* Alert (ticket/email) if update is pending and it has been longer than 8 days after release.
* Preference Pane/Settings removed.

## As of version .9.8.0.0
* Removes the use of `silnite` binary and only relies on information curled from Apple.
* No longer reports MRT, XProtect, or XProtect Remediator information.
* No longer checks if SIP or XProtect is disabled.

## As of version .9.7.0.0
* Uses curl to pull down current OS version information from https://gdmf.apple.com/v2/pmv.
	* Shout out to Ross Matsuda of https://www.sudoade.com/author/ross/ for the excellent write up on how to get the latest OS version updates.
* Uses `curl` result to determine if the current OS matches on alerting for ticket/email (`exit 2`).
* Will run OS version check during every run.
* Configuration Data related to XProtect/MRT/etc will continue to run according to schedule.
* Results for Configuration data will be an informational result (no ticket/email) in the Watchman Monitoring dashboard (`exit 20`).

## As of version .9.5.9:
* Uses `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist` for gathering list of recommended updates (stops using `softwareupdate -l`).
* Adjusts if a plist setting file is missing an expected value.
* Creates a default settings plist on new installation.
* Changes default reporting frequency to 8 from 12 (more frequently).

## As of version .9.0.1:
* Simply a version bump to match current `silnite` binary version number
* Requires silnite 9 to be installed
* Get silnite version 9 from Eclectic Light: https://eclecticlight.co/lockrattler-systhist/

## As of version .7.0.1:
* Adds compatibility for silnite 6, which in turn adds compatibility with Apple Silicon and macOS 12. 
* Get silnite version 6 from Eclectic Light: https://eclecticlight.co/lockrattler-systhist/
* This version is NOT compatible with older versions of silnite. Requires silnite 6 to be installed.



## As of version .6.4.0:

**Preference Pane**
* _Frequency to check for updates_
  * Sets how often a full run will be done. More time between full checks will help speed up regular Watchman Monitoring reporting.

* _Unable to check for updates attempts_
  * If `silnite` is unable to check for updates due to a connection failure, an informational warning will be generated (no tickets/emails) in your Watchman Monitoring dashboard. If the number of attempts exceeds this number, an alert (ticket/email) will be generated.

**Terminal/Command Line Options**
* Force a one-time full run ignoring the frequency count: `sudo defaults write /Library/MonitoringClient/PluginSupport/_wm_silnite_settings.plist First_Run -bool true`
* Set the "Frequency to check for updates" count (set _NUM_ to the number): `sudo defaults write /Library/MonitoringClient/PluginSupport/_wm_silnite_settings.plist Check_For_Updates _NUM_`
* Set the "Unable to check for updates attempts" count (set _NUM_ to the number): `sudo defaults write /Library/MonitoringClient/PluginSupport/_wm_silnite_settings.plist Warn_Updates_Attempts _NUM_`

**Emails daily/ticket created (exit 2) if...**
* `silnite` reports updates are available `UpdateWaiting = 1`

This means...
* MRT could be out-of-date
* XProtect Remediator could be out-of-date
* XProtect could be out-of-date
* Other updates from `softwareupdate` are available and will be listed

**If unable to check for updates, shows informational warning (exit 20)**
Includes report of installed versions:
* MRT 
* XProtect Remediator
* XProtect


**(initial testing complete, still needs more testing) Sends one-time alerts (exit 200) if...**
* SIP Disabled
* XProtect Disabled
